			<p>Dear Power 7 Team,</p>
			<p>I wanted to write you a note to express my appreciation for your excellent service. You have shown me that the process of selling a house does not have to be a painful experience. I sold my home quickly, at a fair price, and without having to deal with the entire process of having to list my property.</p>
			<p>After deciding to relocate to another part of the city, I believed it would take months to list and sell my home through a Realtor, all while dealing with the uncertainly of not knowing exactly when my home would sell. However, working with you, I had signed a contract within days of our initial meeting. There were no surprises, everything went smoothly and as planned, and I was able to relocate without the added anxiety of having to sell my home. </p>
			<p>Again, thank you for your service. I would recommend you to anyone who is thinking of selling their home, regardless of the circumstances, to consider Power 7 Team as an alternative to the Realtor process.</p>
			<p>All the best,</p>
			<p>Happy Clients!</p>

			<p>To Power 7 Team,</p>
			<p>Any potential Buyers or Sellers can feel confident if Power 7 Team is looking after your property.  From the very start they were very professional in their manner of selling our property & kept us informed each week as to how everything was progressing.</p>
			<p>Power 7 Team looked after us well and above other real estate agents we have dealt with before.</p>
			<p>Even though we had difficulties in trying to sell our property, due to neighbourhood issues, nothing deterred them.  They persevered & tried to come up with various strategies to deal with the situation.</p>
			<p>Nothing fazed them even though we felt that we would find it hard to sell.  The end result was that our home did sell due to their professionalism, compassion and hard work.</p>
			<p>We have nothing but the highest regard for Power 7 Team and have no hesitation in recommending them as your Real Estate Agents.</p>
			<p>Yours Truly</p>

			<p>What I am most impressed with is Power 7 Team's organizational skills--knowing what steps are necessary and in what order, paying very close attention to time frames and specific details of the contract and ensuing agreements-essential details that they know because of their extensive experience with short sales-which impacts the viability of the transaction.</p>
			<p>I have already recommended Power 7 Team to my colleagues because of their ability, knowledge and professionalism-all elements that are important for any successful transaction, but especially for those involving short sales.</p>
			<p>I would recommend Power 7 Team for any entity working with a Short Sale process along with any other real estate related matters. </p>
			<p>Thank you so much!</p>

			<p>"Does the realtor really make a difference? I can tell you from firsthand experience, the answer is yes. Until recently, we owned a house on Bur Oak, a house that was put on the market in 2011. Two years, three realtors and zero offers later, we met Power 7 Team. They asked all the right questions, made valuable suggestions and went to work immediately, showing the house to multiple prospective buyers on 'day one'. By 'day two' we had an offer. By 'day three', we had two offers. And three weeks later, we had a check in hand for a property half-a-dozen other realtors were unable to sell. If you're looking for a real estate agent in Markham area, there's only one choice-Power 7 Team."</p>
			<p>Extremely Satisfied Clients!</p>
