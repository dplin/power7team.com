					<span>Who we are</span>
					<div class="accordionContent"><p>We understand that to get the first 60% of marks on a test is not hard; but the last 40% is.  ULife Test/Exam Review Seminars offer unique sessions that are comprehensive, intensive and geared towards helping students achieve the highest marks possible.  ULife seminars give students the strategic edge since ULife seminars are taught by a team of top-notch instructors who have actually taken and succeeded at the course themselves.  We focus only on what matters.  These sessions are designed to help students study efficiently and effectively; leaving more time to practice more high quality and demanding questions (i.e. questions that usually separate the A and C students on a test).  In other words, after each seminar, a student will have a clear understanding of each concept, a complete knowledge of how to do all types of questions and full confidence in their ability to do well on the test.</p></div>

					<div class="accordionContent"><p>As seats are first-come-first-served, students are highly encouraged to register and reserve a seat at our help session beforehand. We cannot guarantee spots to students who have not registered online if help sessions are full. Students are also allowed to walk-in and register at the door on the day of the help session.</p></div>

					<span>The RE/MAX Concept</span>
					<div class="accordionContent"><p>Yes we do! Besides from Test Review Seminars which usually take place the weekend prior to the midterm/exam, we also provide <a class="link_style_1" href="<?php echo URL; ?>programs/tab/2">Small Group Sessions</a> and <a class="link_style_1" href="<?php echo URL; ?>programs/tab/3">1-on-1 Tutoring</a></p></div>

					<span>Committed to real estate service</span>
					<div class="accordionContent"><p>Study packages are offered for limited courses as we think students will actually benefit more from attending the session than practicing the questions on their own. Our expert tutors will be able to help you grasp full understanding of all concepts faster, and they will show you how to tackle all types of questions. With such, you will then be able to practice more demanding questions, do more reviews and be fully prepared for the test. However, to accommodate all students' needs, we do offer study packages for limited courses. Please contact us for more details.</p></div>

					<span>More than 29 Years Above the Crowd</span>
					<div class="accordionContent">
						<p>Since every year many new types of questions are added on the test to separate the students who just blindly memorize material from those that have a true understanding, ULife seminars focus on getting students to fully understand the material and sharpening their problem-solving skills instead of just teaching students the shortcuts or easy ways to solve a question. At each ULife Seminar, key concepts and past test questions will be comprehensively and methodically reviewed. Therefore, students are ready because they understand the material and how to solve each question; not because they memorize the material and or solutions to specific problem types.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:10px;">All of our ULife tutors are postgraduates with PhD and Masters degrees who have actually taken and succeeded at the course themselves.  As a former student, TA and an experienced instructor, our tutors have seen every trick and every question type and know what a student should focus in order to do well in a course.</p>
						<p style="margin-top:10px;">In addition, ULife Academics not only is a professional tutoring company whose mission is to help students to succeed in their university life but also a non profit-oriented company who cares about giving back to the community.  ULife Academics is an official sponsor for SickKids Foundation. Part of ULife's proceeds will be donated to SickKids for the support upbringing of children of our community.</p>		 
						<p style="margin-top:10px;">One measure of being a successful Test preparation group is through students' opinion and evaluations. Over many years of being rated the #1 Test and Exam preparation group at the university level, many students have expressed their gratitude to us for the higher marks they achieved after attending our sessions. Don't just take our word for it. See what your fellow classmates have to say: Testimonials.</p>
